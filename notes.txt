1. Spring Introduction
2. DI or IOC (Inversion of control)
- xml
-annotation
-java configuration
3. container
4. which one is better
5. injection can be done through 2 ways:

-constructor
-setter

HelloWorlk program
-----------------
1. Java class (pojo)
2. class (Main)
3. XML (configuration file)
steps:
create a new maven project.
app.java appears automatically containing the main method
create Spring bean.xml file and initaiate all the proeperties defined in the pojo classes either through constructor or properrties
place the Spring.xml file outside the packages.. i.e. in the main src folder
use ApplicationContext and ClassPathXmlApplicationContext 

Maven 

[artifact id = name of project]
pom.xml - contains all the jar file information
for spring jar files we have a spring community [or we can go the maven repository also]


* BeanFactory and ClassPathXmlApplicationContext are 2 different IOC cotainers used to initiate the beans 
* if you are using the annotations, then use the AnnotationConfiguartionXmlContext container
* we can use both xml file as well as annotations in the same project together in a combination



* there could be multiple cofiguration files in your project. then you can create a final appConfig file which should import 
the other config files.

* What can a contructor inject
-primitive and /string values
-Dependent object
